# Wifi Thermometer

This is an ESP32 based thermometer that will post the temperature 
(and perhaps humidity) of one or more sensors to an MQTT server. 
This is to replace the Beagle Bone Black server that ran for a decade, 
but then became untenable after an operating system upgrade.

The project is continuing where the "SleepBatteryTest" program was
in April 2024. 

It was continued in 2025 to also add an ePaper display.
